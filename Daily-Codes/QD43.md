You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.

Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.

 
Example 1:

Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
Output: "L"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node.val <= n
All the values in the tree are unique.
1 <= startValue, destValue <= n
startValue != destValue



Step By Step Explanation
The getDirections function is called with the root node of the binary tree, the start value (1), and the destination value (4).

Two StringBuilder objects are created to store the paths from the root to the start node and the destination node, respectively: s and d.

The find function is called with the root node (5), the start value (1), and the StringBuilder s.

The root node's value (5) is compared with the start value (1). Since they don't match, the function returns false.
The find function is then recursively called with the left child of the root node (1) and the start value (1).
The find function is called with the left child of the root node (1), the start value (1), and the StringBuilder s.

The left child's value (1) is compared with the start value (1). Since they match, the function appends "L" to the StringBuilder s and returns true.
The find function is called with the root node (5), the destination value (4), and the StringBuilder d.

The root node's value (5) is compared with the destination value (4). Since they don't match, the function returns false.
The find function is then recursively called with the left child of the root node (1) and the destination value (4).
The find function is called with the left child of the root node (1), the destination value (4), and the StringBuilder d.

The left child's value (1) is compared with the destination value (4). Since they don't match, the function returns false.
The find function is then recursively called with the right child of the root node (2) and the destination value (4).
The find function is called with the right child of the root node (2), the destination value (4), and the StringBuilder d.

The right child's value (2) is compared with the destination value (4). Since they don't match, the function returns false.
The find function is then recursively called with the right child of the right child of the root node (4) and the destination value (4).
The find function is called with the right child of the right child of the root node (4), the destination value (4), and the StringBuilder d.

The right child's value (4) is compared with the destination value (4). Since they match, the function appends "RR" to the StringBuilder d and returns true.
The paths from the root to the start node and the destination node have been found: s = "L" and d = "RR".

The common prefix between the two paths is found by iterating from the end of the paths and stopping when the characters at the corresponding positions are different. In this case, the common prefix is empty, so i = 0.

The final directions are constructed by prepending "U" to the remaining part of the start path ("L"), and appending the remaining part of the destination path ("RR") to the common prefix. The final directions are "URR".

The getDirections function returns the final directions: "URR".
