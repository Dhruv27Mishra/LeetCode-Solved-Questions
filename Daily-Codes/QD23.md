Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.
A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.


Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 105



Intuition
The goal is to balance a Binary Search Tree (BST) given its root node. 
To achieve this, we can follow these steps:
Perform an inorder traversal of the given BST to obtain a sorted array of the nodes.
Use the sorted array to construct a new, balanced BST by recursively building the tree from the middle element as the root, and the left and right subarrays as the left and right subtrees.

Approach
Inorder Traversal: We perform an inorder traversal of the given BST and store the nodes in a sorted array sortedArr.
Constructing Balanced BST: We then use the sorted array to construct a new, balanced BST. We do this by recursively building the tree from the middle element as the root, and the left and right subarrays as the left and right subtrees.
