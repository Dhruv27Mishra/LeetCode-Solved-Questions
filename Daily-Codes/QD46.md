You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in the ith row and colSum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.

Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: rowSum = [3,8], colSum = [4,7]
Output: [[3,0],
         [1,7]]
Explanation: 
0th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]
1st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]
0th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]
1st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]
The row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.
Another possible matrix is: [[1,2],
                             [3,5]]
Example 2:

Input: rowSum = [5,7,10], colSum = [8,6,8]
Output: [[0,5,0],
         [6,1,0],
         [2,0,8]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= rowSum.length, colSum.length <= 500
0 <= rowSum[i], colSum[i] <= 108
sum(rowSum) == sum(colSum)





Approach
Initialize Variables:

Create a matrix result with dimensions equal to the lengths of rowSum and colSum.
Use two pointers i and j to keep track of the current row and column being processed.
Iterate Through Rows and Columns:

In a loop, while both pointers i and j are within the bounds of their respective arrays:
Determine the minimum value between rowSum[i] and colSum[j].
Assign this minimum value to result[i][j].
Subtract this value from both rowSum[i] and colSum[j].
Adjust Pointers:

If rowSum[i] becomes zero, move to the next row by incrementing i.
If colSum[j] becomes zero, move to the next column by incrementing j.
Return the Matrix:

Once all elements are processed, return the constructed matrix.
Complexity
Time Complexity:

The algorithm processes each element of the rowSum and colSum arrays exactly once. Thus, the time complexity is (O(m + n)), where (m) is the length of rowSum and (n) is the length of colSum.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is (O(m x n)) for the result matrix.
Step by Step Explanation
To visually explain the logic, consider the example with rowSum = [3, 8] and colSum = [4, 7]:

Initialize Result Matrix:

Result Matrix:
[[0, 0],
 [0, 0]]
First Iteration:

i = 0, j = 0
rowSum[0] = 3, colSum[0] = 4
val = min(3, 4) = 3
Update result[0][0] = 3
Update rowSum[0] -= 3 -> rowSum = [0, 8]
Update colSum[0] -= 3 -> colSum = [1, 7]
Result Matrix:
[[3, 0],
 [0, 0]]
Second Iteration:

i = 1, j = 0
rowSum[1] = 8, colSum[0] = 1
val = min(8, 1) = 1
Update result[1][0] = 1
Update rowSum[1] -= 1 -> rowSum = [0, 7]
Update colSum[0] -= 1 -> colSum = [0, 7]
Result Matrix:
[[3, 0],
 [1, 0]]
Third Iteration:

i = 1, j = 1
rowSum[1] = 7, colSum[1] = 7
val = min(7, 7) = 7
Update result[1][1] = 7
Update rowSum[1] -= 7 -> rowSum = [0, 0]
Update colSum[1] -= 7 -> colSum = [0, 0]
Result Matrix:
[[3, 0],
 [1, 7]]
The final matrix satisfies the given rowSum and colSum constraints, and all elements are non-negative.
