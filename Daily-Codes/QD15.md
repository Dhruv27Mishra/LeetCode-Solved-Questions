You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:

difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).
Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

 

Example 1:

Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
Example 2:

Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

n == difficulty.length
n == profit.length
m == worker.length
1 <= n, m <= 104
1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105


Intuition
Understand the Relationship Between Job and Worker:

Each job has a certain difficulty and offers a specific profit.
Each worker has an ability, and they can only perform jobs that match or are less difficult than their ability.
To maximize the profit for each worker, they should be assigned the most profitable job that they can handle based on their ability.
Preprocess Jobs for Quick Lookup:

Create a list to store the maximum profit obtainable for any given difficulty up to the maximum difficulty. This will help in efficiently finding the best possible job for each worker.
Efficiently Assign Jobs to Workers:

By using a precomputed list of maximum profits up to each difficulty, the profit for each worker can be determined in constant time.
Approach
Determine Maximum Difficulty:

Traverse the difficulty array to find the maximum job difficulty. This will define the size of our profit lookup table.
Construct Profit Lookup Table:

Create an array maxProfitUpToDifficulty where each index represents a difficulty level, and the value at each index represents the maximum profit obtainable for that difficulty.
Iterate over the difficulty and profit arrays to fill in the maximum profit for each specific job difficulty.
Fill in the Maximum Profits:

Ensure that for each difficulty level, the profit is the maximum available up to that difficulty by propagating the highest profit found so far to subsequent difficulties.
Calculate Total Profit for Workers:

For each worker, use their ability to directly look up the best possible profit they can achieve from the maxProfitUpToDifficulty array.
Sum up the profits to get the total profit.
