Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000



Intuition

To find the intersection of two arrays, we need to identify elements that appear in both arrays. By sorting the arrays, we can use a two-pointer approach to efficiently compare elements and collect the intersection.

Approach

Sort both arrays.
Use two pointers to iterate through the arrays.
Compare elements pointed by the two pointers:
If they are equal, add the element to the result and move both pointers forward.
If the element in the first array is smaller, move the pointer of the first array forward.
If the element in the second array is smaller, move the pointer of the second array forward.
Continue until one of the pointers reaches the end of its array.
Return the collected intersection.

Complexity
Time complexity:- 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛 + 𝑚log𝑚), where 𝑛 and 𝑚 are the lengths of the two arrays. This includes the sorting time and linear traversal of the arrays.
Space complexity:- 𝑂(1) for the in-place result collection, not counting the space used for sorting.
