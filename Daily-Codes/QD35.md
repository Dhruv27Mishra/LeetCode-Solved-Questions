There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

Start at the 1st friend.
Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.


Example 1:

Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.

Example 2:

Input: n = 6, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.
 

Constraints:
1 <= k <= n <= 500



Approach
This problem is a variation of the classic Josephus problem, which involves determining the position of the last remaining person after a series of eliminations in a circle. The solution can be approached using a mathematical method, iterating to find the final position. Here's the step-by-step approach:

Initialization: Start by considering the position of the winner as 0 in a 0-indexed system. This simplifies the calculation because the Josephus problem is traditionally solved using 0-based indexing.

Iterative Calculation: Iterate from 1 to n, updating the position of the winner at each step using the formula:
winner=(winner+k)% i

This formula calculates the new position of the winner after each friend is eliminated. The modulo operation ensures the position wraps around the circle.
Convert to 1-indexed: After completing the loop, convert the 0-indexed position to a 1-indexed position by adding 1. This final step aligns the result with the problem's requirement, where friends are numbered from 1 to n.

How it work

Initial Setup: Assume we have n friends sitting in a circle and they are eliminated every k steps.

0-Indexed Calculation: Start with winner = 0. This represents the position of the winner in a 0-based index system.

Iterate Through Friends: For each friend count from 1 to n:

Calculate the new position of the winner after one friend is eliminated using the formula: winner=(winner+k)%i
This ensures that the position wraps around correctly in the circle.
1-Indexed Result: Convert the final result from 0-based index to 1-based index by adding 1. This is because the problem specifies that friends are numbered from 1 to n.
