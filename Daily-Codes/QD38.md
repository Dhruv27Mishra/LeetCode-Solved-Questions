You are given a string s that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.
Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.
Your result should not contain any brackets.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(abcd)"
Output: "dcba"

Example 2:

Input: s = "(u(love)i)"
Output: "iloveu"
Explanation: The substring "love" is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.

Example 3:

Input: s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: First, we reverse the substring "oc", then "etco", and finally, the whole string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
s only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.
It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.



Intuition
The given problem is to reverse substrings enclosed within parentheses, starting from the innermost ones. The nested nature of parentheses suggests using a recursive approach or a stack-based approach to handle the reversals in the correct order. The idea is to treat the problem by breaking it down recursively: whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis, we recursively solve for the substring until the corresponding closing parenthesis, reverse the substring, and then continue.

Approach
Initialization: Convert the string s into a character array for easy manipulation. Initialize a helper function that will perform the recursive operations.
Recursive Helper Function:
Use a StringBuilder to construct the result string.
Iterate through the characters of the string:
If a closing parenthesis ) is encountered, reverse the constructed string and return it to the previous level of recursion.
If an opening parenthesis ( is encountered, increment the index and recursively call the helper function to process the substring inside the parentheses. Append the reversed substring to the current StringBuilder.
For any other character, simply append it to the StringBuilder.
Return the Result: After processing the entire string, return the result as a string.
Complexity
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once, and reversing the substrings is linear in the total number of characters processed.
Space complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack in the worst case of fully nested parentheses and for the StringBuilder used to construct the result.
Step By Step Explanation
Example
Input: (u(love)i)
Output: iloveu
Explanation:

Reverse the substring "love" to "evol".
The string becomes (uevoli).
Reverse the entire string inside the parentheses to get iloveu.
