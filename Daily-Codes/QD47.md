You are given a positive integer k. You are also given:

a 2D integer array rowConditions of size n where rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi], and
a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].
The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.

You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.
Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.

 

Example 1:


Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
Output: []
Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.
 

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 400
1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 104
rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2
1 <= abovei, belowi, lefti, righti <= k
abovei != belowi
lefti != righti




Intuition
The problem can be viewed as a topological sorting problem. We need to order the rows and columns such that the conditions given in rowConditions and colConditions are met. This can be achieved by treating the conditions as directed edges in a graph and performing a topological sort.

Approach
Graph Construction:

Construct a graph for row conditions and another graph for column conditions.
Nodes represent the numbers from 1 to k.
Directed edges represent the conditions, e.g., rowConditions[i] = [a, b] implies an edge from a to b.
Topological Sorting:

Perform topological sorting on both graphs to determine the order of rows and columns.
Use Depth First Search (DFS) for topological sorting and detect any cycles which would make it impossible to satisfy the conditions.
Matrix Construction:

Using the order obtained from the topological sort, place each number from 1 to k in the corresponding position in the k x k matrix.
Validation:

If any cycle is detected during the topological sorting, return an empty matrix as it indicates that it is impossible to satisfy all conditions.
Complexity
Time Complexity:

Constructing the graph: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of rowConditions and colConditions respectively.
Topological Sorting: O(k + n) for rows and O(k + m) for columns.
Matrix construction: O(k^2).
Space Complexity:

Graph storage: O(k + n) for rows and O(k + m) for columns.
Additional space for topological sorting: O(k).
Matrix storage: O(k^2).
