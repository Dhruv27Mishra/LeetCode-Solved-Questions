You are given a 2D integer array descriptions where descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti] indicates that parenti is the parent of childi in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,

If isLefti == 1, then childi is the left child of parenti.
If isLefti == 0, then childi is the right child of parenti.
Construct the binary tree described by descriptions and return its root.

The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.

 
Example 1:


Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
Example 2:


Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent.
The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
 

Constraints:

1 <= descriptions.length <= 104
descriptions[i].length == 3
1 <= parenti, childi <= 105
0 <= isLefti <= 1
The binary tree described by descriptions is valid.



Intuition
The intuition behind this solution is to use a HashMap to store the nodes and their relationships, and a Set to keep track of all the child nodes. By iterating through the descriptions array, we can create the nodes and their left/right child relationships.

Approach
Create a HashMap map to store the nodes, where the key is the node value and the value is the corresponding TreeNode.
Create a Set children to keep track of all the child nodes.
Iterate through the descriptions array:
Extract the parent, child, and isLeft values from the current array.
Add the child to the children Set.
Get or create the parent node using map.getOrDefault().
Set the left or right child of the parent node based on isLeft.
Store the child node in the map.
Find the root node by iterating through the descriptions array again and checking which node value is not present in the children Set.
Return the root node from the map using map.getOrDefault().
Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we iterate through the descriptions array twice, and each operation (getting or creating a node, setting a child, adding to the Set) takes constant time on average.

Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we store all the nodes in the map HashMap, and we also use a children Set to keep track of the child nodes. In the worst case, all nodes are unique and need to be stored in the HashMap.

Step By Step Explanation
let's go through a step-by-step visual explanation of the code using the example input [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]].

Step 1: Initialize the HashMap and Set
We start by creating an empty HashMap map and an empty Set children.

Step 2: Iterate through the descriptions array
First iteration:

descriptions: [20, 15, 1]
Parent: 20
Child: 15
isLeft: 1 (left child)
Add 15 to the children Set
Create a new TreeNode with value 20 and store it in the map
Create a new TreeNode with value 15 and set it as the left child of the 20 node, then store it in the map
Second iteration:

descriptions: [20, 17, 0]
Parent: 20
Child: 17
isLeft: 0 (right child)
Add 17 to the children Set
Get the 20 node from the map and set its right child to a new TreeNode with value 17, then store the 17 node in the map
Third iteration:

descriptions: [50, 20, 1]
Parent: 50
Child: 20
isLeft: 1 (left child)
Add 20 to the children Set
Create a new TreeNode with value 50 and store it in the map
Get the 20 node from the map and set it as the left child of the 50 node, then store the 50 node in the map
Fourth iteration:

descriptions: [50, 80, 0]
Parent: 50
Child: 80
isLeft: 0 (right child)
Add 80 to the children Set
Get the 50 node from the map and set its right child to a new TreeNode with value 80, then store the 80 node in the map
Fifth iteration:

descriptions: [80, 19, 1]
Parent: 80
Child: 19
isLeft: 1 (left child)
Add 19 to the children Set
Create a new TreeNode with value 80 and store it in the map
Create a new TreeNode with value 19 and set it as the left child of the 80 node, then store the 19 node in the map
Step 3: Find the root node
After the iterations, we can see that the node with value 50 is the root node, as it is not present in the children Set.

Step 4: Return the root node
Finally, we return the 50 node from the map.
