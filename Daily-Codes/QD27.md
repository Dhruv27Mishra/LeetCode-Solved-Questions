Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and three types of edges:

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array edges where edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.
Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.


Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

Example 3:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= edges.length <= min(105, 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 3
1 <= typei <= 3
1 <= ui < vi <= n
All tuples (typei, ui, vi) are distinct.

Intuition
The problem of "Maximum Number of Edges to Remove to Ensure Graph Connectivity" can be solved using a Union-Find data structure. The idea is to group the nodes into connected components and then remove the edges that are not necessary for maintaining the connectivity of the graph.

Approach
The approach taken in the provided code is as follows:
Sort the edges in descending order of their type (type 3, then type 2, then type 1).
Create two Union-Find data structures, one for Alice and one for Bob.
Iterate through the sorted edges and process them as follows:

For type 3 edges, try to unite the nodes in both Alice's and Bob's Union-Find structures. If either of the unions is successful, increment the edgeAdd counter.
For type 2 edges, try to unite the nodes in Bob's Union-Find structure. If the union is successful, increment the edgeAdd counter.
For type 1 edges, try to unite the nodes in Alice's Union-Find structure. If the union is successful, increment the edgeAdd counter.
After processing all the edges, check if both Alice and Bob have a single connected component (i.e., their Union-Find structures are united). If so, return the number of edges that were not added (edges.length - edgeAdd). Otherwise, return -1 to indicate that it's not possible to ensure connectivity for both Alice and Bob.

Complexity
Time complexity:O(n log n).
Space complexity:O(n).
