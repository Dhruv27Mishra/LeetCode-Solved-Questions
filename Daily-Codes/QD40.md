There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.

All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.

If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

Note: The positions may be unsorted.


Example 1:

Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].


Example 2:

Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].


Example 3:

Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
 

Constraints:

1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105
1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109
directions[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'
All values in positions are distinct



Coding

Create a list robots that combines positions, healths, directions, and the original indices into a list of lists.
Sort the robots list based on the positions.
Initialize an empty list stack to keep track of the surviving robots.
Iterate through each robot in the sorted robots list:
If the current robot is moving right ("R") or the stack is empty or the last robot in the stack is moving left ("L"), append the current robot to the stack and continue to the next robot.
If the current robot is moving left ("L"):
Set a flag add to True.
While the stack is not empty, the last robot in the stack is moving right ("R"), and add is True:
Get the health of the last robot in the stack as last_health.
If the current robot's health is greater than last_health, pop the last robot from the stack and decrease the current robot's health by 1.
If the current robot's health is less than last_health, decrease the last robot's health by 1 and set add to False.
If the current robot's health is equal to last_health, pop the last robot from the stack and set add to False.
If add is True, append the current robot to the stack.
Return a list of the healths of the surviving robots, sorted by their original indices.

Intuition

The first thing that came to my mind was to simulate this process, but it is clear that due to the fact that the positions are not sorted, this is quite difficult to do.
However, what dissuaded me from sorting for a while was that we need to return the health of the robots in the order in which we were given them (which usually means that sorting is not necessary).
Okay, let's imagine that we sorted the robots. Now we can go through this sorted list and add robots to the stack one by one. Why the stack? Because if we meet a robot that goes to the left, then the first enemy it meets is the last robot that goes to the right that we met.
Thus, the whole logic is that every time we meet a robot that goes to the right, we add it to the stack and every time we meet a robot that goes to the left, we fight it with the last robot on the stack until the last the robot on the stack does not go left (Which means there are no more robots on the left that go right) or until the robot dies.
For better understanding, let's look at an example.
P.S. You can do the same thing but in reverse - go from right to left in the array, append left robots and fight right robots
