You are given an integer array nums.
In one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it to any value.
Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,100,20]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109


SOLUTION:

The `Solution` class contains a method `minDifference` which calculates the minimum difference between the largest and smallest values in an array after making at most three changes (or moves) to the elements in the array.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
    ```java
    int n = nums.length;
    if (n <= 4) return 0;
    ```
    - The method starts by checking the length of the input array `nums`.
    - If the array has 4 or fewer elements, it returns 0 immediately because we can make the array elements equal by changing at most 3 elements, making the difference between the largest and smallest values zero.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
    ```java
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    ```
    - The array `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This helps in easily accessing the smallest and largest elements after any potential moves.

3. **Evaluating Minimum Difference**:
    ```java
    int minDiff = Math.min(
        Math.min(nums[n - 1] - nums[3], nums[n - 2] - nums[2]),
        Math.min(nums[n - 3] - nums[1], nums[n - 4] - nums[0])
    );
    ```
    - The goal is to minimize the difference between the largest and smallest values after making up to three changes. To achieve this, we consider the following scenarios:
        1. Remove the three smallest elements:
            - Difference = `nums[n - 1] - nums[3]`
            - This considers the case where the smallest 3 elements are replaced by the larger elements in the array.
        2. Remove the two smallest and one largest elements:
            - Difference = `nums[n - 2] - nums[2]`
        3. Remove the one smallest and two largest elements:
            - Difference = `nums[n - 3] - nums[1]`
        4. Remove the three largest elements:
            - Difference = `nums[n - 4] - nums[0]`
            - This considers the case where the largest 3 elements are replaced by the smaller elements in the array.
    - `Math.min` is used to find the minimum difference from the above scenarios.

4. **Return the Result**:
    ```java
    return minDiff;
    ```
    - Finally, the method returns the minimum difference found from the evaluated scenarios.

### Summary:
The code sorts the array and then evaluates the possible minimum differences after making up to three moves, by considering the differences between the appropriate elements. The smallest of these differences is returned as the result.
