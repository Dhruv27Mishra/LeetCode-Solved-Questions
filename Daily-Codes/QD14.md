Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

Example 1:

Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5
Example 2:

Input: c = 3
Output: false
 
Constraints:

0 <= c <= 231 - 1

Constraints:

Iterate through all possible values of a from 0 to the integer square root of c.

For each value of a, compute b as the square root of c - a^2.

Check if b is an integer.

If b is an integer, return true.

If no such pair (a, b) is found after the loop, return false.


Complexity:
Time complexity:
The time complexity is O(âˆšc) because we iterate from 0 to the integer square root of c and perform constant-time operations within the loop.
Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
