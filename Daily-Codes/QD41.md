Given a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom.
The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.
One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.


For example, "H2O" and "H2O2" are possible, but "H1O2" is impossible.
Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.

For example, "H2O2He3Mg4" is also a formula.
A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.

For example, "(H2O2)" and "(H2O2)3" are formulas.
Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.
The test cases are generated so that all the values in the output fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: formula = "H2O"
Output: "H2O"
Explanation: The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'O': 1}.
Example 2:

Input: formula = "Mg(OH)2"
Output: "H2MgO2"
Explanation: The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'Mg': 1, 'O': 2}.
Example 3:

Input: formula = "K4(ON(SO3)2)2"
Output: "K4N2O14S4"
Explanation: The count of elements are {'K': 4, 'N': 2, 'O': 14, 'S': 4}.
 

Constraints:

1 <= formula.length <= 1000
formula consists of English letters, digits, '(', and ')'.
formula is always valid.



Explanation

The goal is to count the number of atoms in a chemical formula string, which can include nested structures with parentheses. We use a stack to handle these nested structures efficiently.


Steps:

Initialize a Stack:

We use a stack to keep track of the counts of atoms at different levels of nesting.
Initially, push an empty map onto the stack to represent the top level of the formula.
Iterate through the Formula:
We iterate through each character of the formula.

Open Parenthesis '(':

When encountering '(', push a new empty map onto the stack. This marks a new level of nesting.
Close Parenthesis ')':
When encountering ')', pop the top map from the stack. This map contains counts of atoms within the parenthesis.
Determine the multiplier following the parenthesis (if any). Multiply all counts in the popped map by this multiplier.
Merge these multiplied counts into the map now on the top of the stack.


Element:

Identify the element's name (which starts with an uppercase letter and may include lowercase letters).
Determine the count following the element name (default is 1 if no number follows).
Add this element and its count to the map on the top of the stack.


Build the Result:

After processing the entire formula, pop the final map from the stack.
This map now contains the counts of all atoms in the formula.
Extract the keys (atom names) from the map and sort them.
Construct the result string by appending each atom and its count (if greater than 1) to a StringBuilder.
